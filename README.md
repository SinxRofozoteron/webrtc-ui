The `Tag` is one of the following:

- `Fix` - for a bug fix.
- `Update` - either for a backwards-compatible enhancement or for a rule change that adds reported problems.
- `New` - implemented a new feature.
- `Breaking` - for a backwards-incompatible enhancement or feature.
- `Docs` - changes to documentation only.
- `Build` - changes to build process only.
- `Upgrade` - for a dependency upgrade.
- `Chore` - for refactoring, adding tests, etc. (anything that isn't user-facing).
